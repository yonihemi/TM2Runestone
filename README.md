# TM2Runestone

Runestone is an awesome text editor for iOS/iPadOS currently being developed by [Simon B. St√∏vring](https://twitter.com/simonbs).

This library converts [tmTheme](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/color_schemes_tmtheme.html) files used in TextMate/Sublime and many other editors to `runestonetheme` files.

## Usage
See [RunestoneThemes](https://github.com/yonihemi/RunestoneThemes) for sample usage.

## Todo

- [ ] Translate scopes between tmTheme and tree-sitter more intelligently. Current implementation is based on trial and error.

- [ ] Support Runestone interface theming based on text styles.

- [ ] Better detection for dark themes.

- [ ] More robust testing.
